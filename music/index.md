Some of my amateur music compositions.

<h2>Ensquare main menu</h2>
I wrote this for a friend, to use in a game he created, called Ensquare. Ensquare is a really cute game, with cute graphics, and I wanted to capture that same cute liveliness in the music. This piece is the main menu music for Ensquare.

The first track one, mainmenuloop2, was one of the earlier versions of the song - you can hear some notes that are painfully offbeat >_>. But I actually prefer this to the final version.

The second track, mainmenu5, was the song that was used in the game. I fixed the timing issues, and took away the claps and moved the main melody down by one octave. I really like the claps, because I feel like they add an extra dimension to the song - it sounds catchier to me, at least - but in the end I decided they didn't sound appropriate as part of a main menu song. I have no idea why moved the melody down by an octave though. I think it sounds better an octave higher. Why did I do that...?

<h4>Ensquare main theme</h4>
This was also written for Ensquare, to be the main music that would play during the game itself. I gave it the same elements, and tried to use the same instruments as the main menu music, so that the two songs sound related - part of the same game. 

Unfortunately, I didn't quite manage to get this to sound the way I imagined it in my head. I just couldn't find the right instrument for the main melody. I think it's because I imagined it to sound more midi-ish with flat tones, but my music library didn't have instruments with the sound I was going for. Overall though, I think it's still pretty decent, and has the cute, upbeat feeling I was going for.

<h4>Dungeon music thing</h4>
This was written for a game during a hackathon. The game was set in a dungeon, so I tried to give this a mysterious, suspenseful kind of sound. The theme for the song isn't really very developed, but I'm still quite proud of it considering I had to rush it out in 2 hours. Unfortunately, it wasn't used in the game in the end, as the team decided to go with a more fast-paced song, to set a more exciting and lively atmosphere for the game.

<h4>Work in Progress</h4>
Currently still a work in progress. My goal when writing this piece, was to make something that sounded like movie trailer music. This is also the first piece I worked on after getting my keyboard and sound library, so it was very experimental. So far though, I think it sounds pretty good, and I hope to be able to finish it soon!
