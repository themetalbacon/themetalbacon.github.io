Hi there!
</p>
<p>
If you already know my url, you probably know my name too. If not, you can think of me as this adorable pig: <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/piggy.png" />
</p>
<p>
Why TheMetalBacon, you ask?
</p>
<p>
Well, when I was choosing my name, I knew the most important thing was that it had to be delicious. So I chose the most delicious for in the world: Bacon
</p>
<p>
Next, I knew it had to be something grungy, something kickass. MyChemicalBacon? Nah. FireBacon? Meh. SuperBacon? Lame. And then I thought: what's more hardcore than Metal? Therefore, I was MetalBacon.
</p>
<p>
But there was still something missing. I wanted something that would set me apart from all the other MetalBacons. Something that would make me the one and only, special MetalBacon. And then it came to me; I realised that I would be THE Metal Bacon.
</p>
<p>
And so TheMetalBacon was made and I saw that it was good.

Ok. The truth is, I'm actually a human being with hair and a nose. I like eating, sleeping, making stuff and tinkering with music. I'm a strong believer and advocate of breathing and thinking.
