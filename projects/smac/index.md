## Description ##
The [SMAC Project](http://www.smacproject.org/) is a project that aims to interest children in programming. It is designed to be  requiring only 3 things: a monitor, a raspberry pi, and a robotic toolkit. 
Using the raspberry pi, the user can easily install chrome/chromium. With chrome, they can install the Chrome Web App for SMAC. The SMAC chrome web app allows the user to code either using Java or Blockly. The code is then parsed as JSON, and set to the robotic toolkit, causing the robot to move according to the code. This allows children to learn as they can see, touch and experience the effects of their code almost instantaneously, allowing them full immersive programming experience. The project is also intended to be easily available and affordable to the public.
## The Process ##

### Technologies ###
+ JavaScript for Chrome Web App

I joined the SMAC Project team as a software developer. Currently, we are working on getting the chrome web app to send information to the robotic toolkit.
