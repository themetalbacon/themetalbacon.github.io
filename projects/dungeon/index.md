## Description ##
Cubey's Dungeon is a multiplayer game that incorporates different technologies. It was developed during a Hackathon and won First Prize and Best Use of Project Tango.

### Game Concept ###
Cubey's Dungeon can be played by two or more players. One player acts as the "Dungeon Master". Using Leap Motion Technology, the Dungeon Master, can spawn monsters with specific gestures. The other players, armed with a Project Tango each, have to traverse the maze while blasting the monsters. If they get hit by 3 or more monsters, they lose. If they can get to the end of the maze, they win!

## The Process ##

### Technologies ###
+ Unity 3D Engine
+ Leap Motion 
+ Google's Project Tango

Cubey's Dungeon was made by a team effort of 4 members. My part in the team was primarily to design the maze and incorporate the Leap Motion features using the Leap Motion Unity API.
