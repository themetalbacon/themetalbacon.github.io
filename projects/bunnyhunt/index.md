## Description ##
Bunny Hunt is an Android App that aims to teach children spelling. 

### Game Concept ###
The player is presented with a cute scene and a clue. They have to solve the clue to figure out what the item is, click on the item and spell it. 

If they get it correct, they will be presented with another clue, until they reach the end of the level. There are 4 levels in total.

If they get it wrong, the player loses a life. The game ends when a player loses all 3 lives.

## The Process ##

### Technologies ###
+ Java 
+ Android Studio

Bunny Hunt was made during a 2-day Hackathon at Vanderbilt by me and my friend. I coded it while she worked on theart. We later had a third person join to help give feedback and improve the UI.

It was the first time for both of us participating in a Hackathon, and were really happy to win Best Education App.
